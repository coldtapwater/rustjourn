## some things i liked

+ i liked that thinking about this simple project/script in python was able to translate really well into rust. i think potentially recreating my calculus calculator will be fairly easy now
+ i learned `const` recommends all caps naming which deviates from `C` and `python` so that was fun getting used to but it does make it easier to find where you are calling your constants

## some things i didnt like

+ i keep forgetting you dont have to `return` variables in functions like you would in python and it is super annoying because im so used to that. it just makes sense
+ also the inconsistency of semicolons within functions is confusing and i dont like that
