## some things i liked / enjoyed

+ the syntax is very much like python
+ i have grown to like / not get annoyed at the `let` or `let mut` prefixes to define variables
+ i like the way you can chain methods together

## things i didn't like

+ i dont like the way input is taken compared to python
+ i didnt like the way you have to define the dependencies in the [cargo.toml](guessing_game/Cargo.toml) file in order to actually use the package
